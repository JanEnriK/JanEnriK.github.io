	<blockquote><p>Skills are something a person have whenever he is really good at something or knowledgeable on executing something effectively.<sup>1</sup> Skills are something that a person develop for a certain amount of time and will require a lot of practice and consistency.<sup>2</sup> My skills in particular are highly influenced from my cousins, interests and my goal profession.<sup>3</sup> One skill that I have and genuinely like is video editing.<sup>4</sup> When it comes to video editing, I am not the most proficient but I am knowledgeable about the basics.<sup>5</sup> Video editing provides me freedom and creativity in edits.<sup>6</sup> It also has some artistic aspect in taking advantage of transitions.<sup>7</sup> I can say that editing is a very broad skill and every detail is an important aspect of the output.<sup>8</sup> With that the next skill that I have is basic photo editing which is similar with video editing.<sup>9</sup> Unlike video editing photo editing is much simple because there is only one frame that is needed to be edited.<sup>10</sup> The best photo editing tool is photoshop which requires a lot of familiarity of the software.<sup>11</sup> Another skill that I have is playing the guitar which is also a part of my hobbies and interest.<sup>12</sup> Learning to play guitar is also a hard skill to develop because it is same as learning a new language and speaking it.<sup>13</sup> Guitar playing is a skill that I want to continuously develop however it is a very time consuming and complex skill to learn.<sup>14</sup> Next skill is programming, it is a skill that is in its early stage of development.<sup>15</sup> It is a skill that I think will continue on developing and advancing because most programming language keeps on changing as new versions gets released.<sup>16</sup> Programming is the same with studying the guitar, they are both same as learning a brand-new language and applying it.<sup>17</sup> When it comes to programming, I am still trying to learn and continue developing it.<sup>18</sup> Programming is a skill that is very important skill to have for my course and future profession.<sup>19</sup> Most of these skills of mine are still developing and I wish that I learn new skills while also improve the once I currently have.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p> Hobbies are something I like to do in my own spare time and some of them help shape my skills and interest.<sup>1</sup> First of which is what is common to most teenagers in this generation which is browsing social media.<sup>2</sup> Most of my free time is used on my phone scrolling Facebook, Instagram twitter and YouTube.<sup>3</sup> Scrolling through social media can have various benefits and disadvantages.<sup>4</sup> One of the benefits can include gaining new knowledge about the world which can be through news, updates from friends and shared articles.<sup>5</sup> Another benefit is it can provide entertainment to users through a form of videos, photos, and memes.<sup>6</sup> However, social media can also have disadvantages such as toxicity, fake news, and can lead to accuracy.<sup>7</sup> Another one of my hobbies is one of my skills which is playing the guitar.<sup>8</sup> Playing the guitar is a hobby that I put less time to because it can use up a lot of time when learning new songs and practicing.<sup>9</sup> However, I wish that guitar playing is one of the hobbies that I am really good at because it can provide a lot of opportunity such as composition and freestyle playing.<sup>10</sup> I also like listening to music whenever I do my assignments, chores and free time.<sup>11</sup> Music can provide both entertainment and comfort to a person which is why we always listen to it.<sup>12</sup> Another hobby that I have is something that is slowly becoming more mainstream which is gaming.<sup>13</sup> Gaming is a common activity to teenagers where we can become a lot competitive than others.<sup>14</sup> What fun about gaming is that, we get to compete with other people while also having fun.<sup>15</sup> In the world of gaming, I can find new people with the same interest which can lead to finding friends from all over the world.<sup>16</sup> Lastly, another hobby that I have is watching movies and series.<sup>17</sup> Movies and series provide the best entertainment of all of my hobbies because they can provide unique kinds of stories.<sup>18</sup> They also provide good conversation to friends and family members when talking about their favorite movies and series.<sup>19</sup> These are hobbies that provide me entertainment and something to do during my free time which is a good distraction from reality and enjoying life.<sup>20</sup> </p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p>Interests are things and activities that I like to know about and learn more about.<sup>1</sup> My interests are composed of thing that I already know and would like to know more.<sup>2</sup> Some of them are from my skills and hobbies but most of them is something that I havenâ€™t experienced yet.<sup>3</sup> Skill and hobbies that interests me are programming, gaming, watching movies and series and scrolling social media.<sup>4</sup> Most of these are something that I will never lose interest because it is important for my future career like programming.<sup>5</sup> Another thing that interests me is traveling around the world.<sup>6</sup> However, it is something that can cost a lot of money and takes a lot of time.<sup>7</sup> Traveling interest, me because I will be able to look at new places abroad and differentiate it from here in the Philippines.<sup>8</sup> Another thing is I will be able to meet different types of people with different culture and practices.<sup>9</sup> Next thing that interests me is having a collection of collectibles like shoes, clothing rare toys and in game items.<sup>10</sup> Collecting is something that only interest me but I donâ€™t currently do because it is expensive and it is hard to buy and sell collections here in the Philippines.<sup>11</sup> Collecting can be both a waste of money or a good investment.<sup>12</sup> However, I think collecting is cool especially when you get rare stuff that are limited edition and a lot of people are wanting to get it.<sup>13</sup> You can make a lot of money from collecting because some people are willing to buy collections specifically complete ones.<sup>14</sup> Another interest that I have is producing something in the creative field.<sup>15</sup> I am willing to learn anything when it comes to producing something it can be from creating music, editing videos, editing photos and making digital arts.<sup>16</sup> However, these are skills thatâ€™s going to take a lot of time to learn and master.<sup>17</sup> It also takes a lot of focus and dedication which can cost your main profession.<sup>18</sup> Producing is another way of opening up opportunities to creative sectors and represent around the world.<sup>19</sup> Interests is something that can help motivate me to work for something in life.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
