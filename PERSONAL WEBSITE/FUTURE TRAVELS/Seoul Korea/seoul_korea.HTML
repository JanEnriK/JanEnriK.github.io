    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seoul, South Korea is a vibrant and exciting city, one that deftly combines ancient history with ultra-modern design and technology. The city is filled with a wide range of tourist attractions of all types, from outdoor adventures like exploring Mount Namsan and its surrounding park to indoor fun like visiting one of Seoul's many museums. Seoul is also a city of palaces, with five huge palace complexes located throughout the city and now restored to their former glory. </p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itaewon is a bustling neighborhood of Seoul focused on a few pedestrian streets filled with shops, caf√©s, and other consumer businesses. It's one of those places that can give you a real feel for Korean retail culture in a short time period. There are food carts, street performers, and some of the side streets are filled with restaurants. This is an excellent place to wander around and just lose yourself in the energy of the city. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population is made up almost entirely of Korean citizens, who are almost all ethnically Korean. Foreign residents constitute a small but appreciable fraction of the populace; they are not concentrated in any particular areas but are distributed across the city.</p>
