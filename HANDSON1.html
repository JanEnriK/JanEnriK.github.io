    <blockquote><div align="justify"><p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 20px; word-spacing: 1px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My childhood life is an interesting phase for me because this are the years where I was free from responsibilities and I am able to do things<sup>1</sup>. The best thing about being a child is being amazed in learning new things that I have never seen before<sup>2</sup>. When I was a child one of my favorite things to do is play different types of games outside<sup>3</sup>. I am lucky because I have experience most of old-school games with my neighborhood friends<sup>4</sup>. We often go outside 9 in the morning and we play until before lunch and continue playing after a short afternoon nap<sup>5</sup>. In terms of playing games, we played most games which ranges from tag, hopscotch, <i>pogs</i>, marbles, base taking and many other active physical games<sup>6</sup>. Games is only a part of my childhood years there are other things that shaped my personality growing up<sup>7</sup>. Another part of my childhood years is events and hangout with family members<sup>8</sup>. Every special event with our family is one of my most anticipated days because I get to meet my grandparents, uncle, aunt and cousins<sup>9</sup>. Every Christmas we first go the cemetery with my family and my uncle’s family during the day<sup>10</sup>. It is the best time where I get to hangout with my cousins from my mother’s side while eating and sharing life stories<sup>11</sup>. After going to the cemetery, we go to my grandparent’s house from my father side<sup>12</sup>. In there I get to hangout with my cousins from the father side<sup>13</sup>. When I was a child, I had a lot of professions I wanted to peruse however I ended up not pursing and of them today<sup>14</sup>. I wanted to become magician, engineer, businessman, and an inventor<sup>15</sup>. Most of these professions is highly influenced from tv shows and cartoons from the tv<sup>16</sup>. I also had a lot of learning experience from making mistake from poor decisions as a child<sup>17</sup>. Such as when I got a stray cat to scratch me by throwing something to it during the day before my sister’s graduation<sup>18</sup>. Because of the cat scratch I decided that I hide the scratch which led for me getting infection<sup>19</sup>. One of the memories that I wish I am able to recall was my childhood experiences in school<sup>20</sup>. Before go to an event once a year for G6PD kids where there are a lot of activities for kids to do such as party games, educational tutorials and output-based activities<sup>21</sup>.</p></div></blockquote>

    <!--TEENAGE YEARS-->
    <div align = "left"><dd><h2 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: uppercase; ">Teenage Years</h2></dd></div>

    <blockquote><div align="justify"><p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 20px; word-spacing: 1px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider my teenage years as my most exciting years of my life because during these years I am able to make decisions which shape my character<sup>1</sup>. The most influential is my experiences and the people I meet in high school<sup>2</sup>. I’ve gone to high school as UST Angelicum which is just a walking distance away from home<sup>3</sup>. During my first year of high school this is the year where I realized that education is important and I started to actually work hard for school<sup>4</sup>. This is also the times where I am able to overcome my shyness and I am able to meet new friends<sup>5</sup>. In my four years of junior high school, I developed interest in computers and technology<sup>6</sup>. What got me interested in pursuing Information technology is the subject robotics<sup>7</sup>. It is where there are groups of four students who work together in building and coding the robot’s action to do a task<sup>8</sup>. Another of my favorite is during my senior high school, before enrolling I have decided that in college, I will take IT as my course and I should choose a good senior high strand that is related to IT<sup>9</sup>. At first, I was thinking about choosing either information and communications technology strand or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics strand<sup>10</sup>. I ended up choosing STEM as my strand because I decided that I needed to be ready for other course in case I change my mind in the last second of enrolling in college<sup>11</sup>. The best part of my 2-year senior high experience is my classmates because our sections didn’t change in four semester which strengthened our bond and we all consider each other as family<sup>12</sup>. Senior high school is a unique experience for me because I was able to do things that I won’t be able to experience from personal choice<sup>13</sup>. One of the experiences is when I got forced to join the cheer dance group as a lifter for second year intramurals<sup>14</sup>. Second year intramurals are great because our section grouped up with another section from ICT strand where I met the most amazing group of people<sup>15</sup>. Senior high school is a very memorable part of my life however it did not end in a good term because of the pandemic and the active taal volcano<sup>16</sup>. One of the supposed to be highlight of our senior high school life was the two-day three-night retreat which I think would have been fun with friends<sup>17</sup>. Another supposed to be highlight that didn’t go through is the grad ball which is supposed to be like a prom weeks before graduation.<sup>18</sup> Lastly, which I think is what would be much important is graduation which is supposed to be held at UST<sup>19</sup>. However, because of the pandemic all of those events didn’t continue which is the only regret<sup>20</sup>.</p></div></blockquote>

    <!--COLLAGE YEARS-->
    <div align = "left"><dd><h2 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 1.5em; font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: uppercase; ">Collage Years</h2></dd></div>

    <blockquote><div align="justify"><p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 20px; word-spacing: 1px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My college years is one of my most anticipated time I’m looking forward to experience however college started as an online<sup>1</sup>. With classes being online most of the personal experience outside of school is missing<sup>2</sup>. It is only the second year of college which opens up to more things to look forward to<sup>3</sup>. As an IT student I was nervous at first that won’t be able to grasp the lesson in writing codes<sup>4</sup>. In first year, first semester I was having a hard time adjusting to the whole online class<sup>5</sup>. What surprised me the most is the subject about databases because it was the first time, I had that type of subject or concept<sup>6</sup>. Programming is another subject that challenged me because it is a practiced based skill to acquire<sup>7</sup>. But as time goes by, I got to familiarize in using java and python as a programming language<sup>8</sup>. One I familiarized the language the only thing that I need to do is to think of how to approach the problem<sup>9</sup>. Approaching problems is hard especially if it relies on patterns, math and algorithm<sup>10</sup>. Another special thing I experience is when I got notified that I was able to get a full scholarship for the second semester<sup>11</sup>. When I got that notification, I strived during the second semester in hoping to get another scholarship<sup>12</sup>. However, I didn’t make it because the guideline in getting a scholarship changed and the grantees was lessened<sup>13</sup>. Next is second year’s first semester where I decided that for the first time I will try to enroll in a free section<sup>14</sup>. During this semester I was able to meet new people in different years which also helped me through my subjects<sup>15</sup>. Now I am currently enrolled for the second semester and looking forward to the subject that I have<sup>16</sup>. The subject I am currently looking forward the most is Integrative programming and technologies because it is about web programming<sup>17</sup>. This will be my first web-based programming subject and I am hoping that I am able to learn and understand it well<sup>18</sup>. These are most of my current experiences for my one and a half year<sup>19</sup>. For the rest of my college years I look forward to experience the face to face in university of the east at least one year or semester<sup>20</sup>.</p></div></blockquote>
